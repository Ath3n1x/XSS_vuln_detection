# XSS Vulnerability Prediction

Combining Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to perdict using classification whether a website has XSS vuln or not.

I built this project as part of my learning process for data science and machine learning. So there is 2 different parts to this project.
Part 1: Preprocessing with Data Science
-> Here I used a sythetic dataset with some preprocessing needs to work out the different preprocessing techniques and to check the differnce in accuracies.

Part 2: Comparison of 3 different datasets (publically available) by applying 3 machine learning algorithms (RF, Logistic Regression and SVM). 

Please find the ppt for the findings of the ML techniques applied [Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM]: [link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGZpv6zK18/GIVe0WGz-FqxZfqF3hslaQ/edit?utm_content=DAGZpv6zK18&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
